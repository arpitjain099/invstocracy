      h3 Why
    |        FundMyVenture is here to make angel investing easy for everyone. The aim of FundMyVenture is to enable innovative companies with solid business understanding to raise funds. Startup owners should focus on building their businesses rather than spending their energy chasing investors and attending (useless) meetings. 
    br
    br
    |        FundMyVenture offers fund raising capabilities by two routes - equity and debt based financing. While equity based financing is targeted for early stage businesses (with relatively high risk of failure), debt based financing caters to established and mature businesses which are able to provide a low-risk capital gain mechanism to investors. Sign up with FundMyVenture - Your Gateway to investment in unlisted companies!

      h3 Vision
    |        We aim to become the leading portal for businesses to raise money from the people. We look at democratization of capital providing investors to put their money in alternative financial instruments like equity and debt based financing. Our sincere belief is that it is not compulsory for a private unlisted company to run after traditional sources of private equity like venture capital and offline angel groups.
