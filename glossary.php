<b>Cash return</b> – The "cash on cash return," also sometimes called the "equity dividend rate", is a simple ratio measurement of an investor's return in relation to the cash actually invested.

For example if the net operating income is $150,000, the debt service is $50,000, and the amount initially invested is $1 million, then: <br>
(Net operating income less debt service) / initial equity investment = ($150,000 - 50,000) / $1,000,000 = 10% cash on cash return
