       <u><h3>What is it about?</h3></u>
   FundMyVenture's vision is to enable people realize their dreams with the support of people around them. Start a campaign, if you feel that you have a business idea which has the potential to be raised by local community around you.
       <br><br>
       <u><h3>Examples</h3></u>
       <div class="row">
        
          <div class="col-md-4"><img src="assets/images/doctor.png" width="100%"/></div><div class="col-md-8">Praveen is a MBBS, MS opthalmology from AIIMS, New Delhi. He wants to set up a specialty eye hospital on the outskirts of his hometown Agra along with two of his medico friends. The total cost involved (along with the machines) is about INR 2 crore. He also seeks support from influential people in Agra so that he can focus on running the hospital. Praveen comes to FundMyVenture and creates his campaign giving expense breakup, projected cash flow cycles, time for the investment to pay off, and profit margins. People around Agra who understand the value behind Praveen's venture invest both time and money to help set up the hospital.</div>
          
          <div class="col-md-4"><img src="assets/images/graduate.png" width="100%"/></div><div class="col-md-8">Raj is a teacher from Kendriya Vidyalaya School, Lucknow. He has been teaching students for the past 25 years and has good understanding about running a school, curriculum and other aspects. Raj wants to set up a school for girls around his locality in Lucknow. He seeks INR 50L as starting capital along with 5 people as support staff. Raj puts his vision about the school on FundMyVenture and is able to raise 39L. The amount, though, is less than what Raj originally expected to raise but is sufficient for him  to begin.</div>

       <u><h3>How is it different from fundraising by startups?</h3></u>
       Campaigns are different from startup fundraise as campaigns are focused on connecting businesses which are currently in idea stage, and require necessary local funds and support.  FundMyVenture is different from platforms like <a href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> as we focus on solid business ideas where investors can contribute effort, mentorship as well as financial assistance to help you set up the business.
